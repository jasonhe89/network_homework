\outl0\strokewidth0 \strokec2 Characterizing Radio Resource Allocation for 3G Networks the author give us the detail of RPC state machine of different carrier. Also author talks about the issue of current RPC state machine and gives his explaination and his solution to this issues of high cost energy and ineffciency. The key of the solution is traffic pattern. \
In the paper an In-depth Study of LTE: Effect of Network Protocol and Application Behavior on Performance the author researched the impact of protocol and application behaviors on the network performance. They observe that some TCP behaviors, such as not updating RTT estimation using duplicate ACKs, can cause severe performance issues in LTE networks upon a single packet loss. Also they by their new bandwidth estimation, they find that for 71.3% of the large flows, the bandwidth utilization ratio is below 50%. Also the large RTT and limited window size cause the under-utilization. They think LTE-friendly transport protocol mechanisms and applications are needed.}
